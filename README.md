# **Global Mental Health Trends Analysis (2007–2016)**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the complete analysis of global mental health trends from 2007 to 2016. The study focuses on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders across genders, regions, and socioeconomic conditions. Using data from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization, World Happiness Report, and World Bank, this project provides actionable insights for addressing mental health challenges.

## **Problem Statement**
A mental health tech startup seeks to launch an AI-driven app to manage stress and anxiety. This project aims to inform the startup's market entry strategy by analyzing mental health trends, identifying high-prevalence regions, and exploring gender and regional disparities.

---

## **Project Objectives**
1. Analyze global trends in anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.
2. Identify regional and gender-specific disparities in mental health prevalence.
3. Examine correlations between mental health and external factors like GDP, unemployment, and happiness scores.
4. Provide data-driven recommendations for targeted interventions and app development.

## **Data Sources**
1. **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Prevalence data on anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.
2. **World Happiness Report**: Happiness index for various countries.
3. **World Bank**: GDP and unemployment rates.

---

## **Key Insights**
- **Gender Disparities**: Women exhibit higher prevalence rates of anxiety and depression globally.
- **Regional Trends**: South America and the Middle East report elevated anxiety rates; Greenland shows high substance use prevalence.
- **External Correlations**: Weak correlation between GDP/unemployment and mental health prevalence; stronger association with happiness scores.
- **Temporal Patterns**: Depression rates are declining, while anxiety rates remain stable.

## **Analysis Structure**
### **1. Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Merged multiple datasets containing mental health prevalence, happiness scores, and economic indicators.
   - Cleaned and standardized columns for easier analysis.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized global trends over time.
   - Identified top 10 countries with the highest gender disparity in anxiety prevalence.

### **3. Insights and Findings**
   - Compared mental health prevalence across genders and regions.
   - Analyzed socioeconomic factors and their impact on mental health trends.

### **4. Recommendations**
   - Target regions with high anxiety prevalence.
   - Develop gender-specific app features for women’s mental health.
   - Leverage happiness scores for awareness campaigns in low-happiness regions.

## **Results**
- **Top Countries by Gender Disparity**: Brazil, Chile, Spain, and France show the largest gaps in anxiety prevalence between genders.
- **Target Markets**: High-income countries with high anxiety prevalence (e.g., New Zealand, Germany, Portugal).
- **Actionable Insights**: Gender-specific interventions and culturally localized solutions can address these disparities effectively.
